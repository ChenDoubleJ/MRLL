## 📌 Overview

**BLFusion** is an unsupervised darkness- and noise-aware infrared-visible image fusion framework for challenging nighttime scenes. It is designed to jointly handle two major low-light barriers: insufficient illumination and complex real-world noise.

<p align="center">
  <img width="861" alt="BLFusion overview" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/facb4247-a1f4-40e5-bfac-b2c34bcb44ab" />
</p>

Existing low-light fusion methods often focus on brightness enhancement while overlooking noise suppression. Degradation-aware supervised methods can model multiple degradations, but they usually rely on paired high-quality references and may suffer from imbalanced optimization between enhancement and denoising.

BLFusion addresses these issues with a customized two-stage unsupervised framework. The first stage enhances dark visible images through Retinex-guided decomposition with state space modeling. The second stage performs denoising and fusion jointly, producing fused images with clearer structures, richer textures, and stronger robustness under real low-light noise.

## ✨ Highlights

- **Darkness- and noise-aware fusion**: simultaneously improves illumination and suppresses complex noise in low-light infrared-visible fusion.
- **Retinex-guided SSM decomposition**: combines Retinex theory with state space modeling to enhance dark visible images while preserving structural details.
- **Unsupervised denoising fusion**: integrates pixel-shuffle downsampling, blind-spot networks, and dilated convolutions to learn noise-free features without clean references.
- **Maximum replacement refinement**: reduces visual artifacts and further improves fused image quality during inference.
- **MRLL dataset**: provides 500 aligned infrared-visible image pairs captured from real-world indoor and outdoor nighttime scenes.

## 🧩 Framework

</p>

BLFusion contains two dedicated stages:

1. **State Space Model-Based Decomposition Network**: decomposes low-light visible images into illumination and reflectance components. The Retinex-inspired design models illumination degradation, while efficient state space modules capture long-range dependencies and preserve fine visual details.
2. **Unsupervised Denoising and Fusion Network**: extracts noise-suppressed features from enhanced visible and infrared images. Pixel-shuffle downsampling disrupts spatial noise correlation, blind-spot networks avoid identity mapping, and dilated convolutions expand contextual perception for robust denoising and fusion.

# MRLL Dataset

**MRLL** stands for **Multi-modal Real-world Low-Light Dataset**. It is a synchronized dual-spectral dataset built for infrared-visible image fusion under realistic nighttime degradation.

MRLL contains **500 well-aligned infrared-visible image pairs** with a resolution of **960 x 720**. The dataset covers diverse indoor and outdoor low-light scenes, varying illumination levels, and complex real-world noise patterns, making it suitable for evaluating fusion models under practical nighttime conditions.
